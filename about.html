        I wanted to learn some basic animations and create a fun website for my home server 
        since I had already set up my NAS, a Minecraft server with a 3D map, and a nginx reverse 
        proxy. I did some research, clicked through some demos, and eventually 
        stumbled across GSAP as a simple library to learn basic animations.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I was scrolling through the demos of the library on CodePen, I stumbled across 
        <em><a href="https://codepen.io/GreenSock/pen/mdVEpKK">How to Animate a Coffee Drinking Sprite With ScrollTrigger</a></em> and immediately 
        thought that a simple, stop-motion style animation would be a great fit for my personal site.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create the animation, I recorded a slow motion video of myself waving in my room 
        using my Pixel 7 and Open Camera. I used a phone mount attached to an old chair and a light 
        therapy lamp that I own to take the video in my room as seen in the following photo. I uploaded 
        this video to my NAS and used VLC media player to take captures every few frames for 
        the animation. I ended up with 40 captures that I stiched together using 
        <em><a href="https://imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a></em>, a command line tool for image processing.
