# About SkynetDC
This is the code for the webserver that is running on my personal site. I used the GSAP Javascript library for the animations on the site.

## Inspiration
I wanted to learn some basic animations and create a fun website for my home server since I had already set up my NAS, a Minecraft server with a 3D map, a nginx reverse proxy and HTTPS. I did some research, clicked through some demos, and eventually stumbled across GSAP as a simple library to learn basic animations. As I was scrolling through the demos of the library on codepen, I stumbled across [How to Animate a Coffee Drinking Sprite With ScrollTrigger](https://codepen.io/GreenSock/pen/mdVEpKK) and immediately thought that a simple, stop motion style animation would be a great fit for my personal site.
